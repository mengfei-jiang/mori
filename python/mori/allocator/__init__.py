"""Register mori as a torch SymmetricMemory backend. Requires **torch >= 2.9**.

torch owns the allocation and its lifetime; CCO owns the peer addressing. ``alloc`` is
plain HIP VMM, and ``rendezvous`` hands that allocation to ``ccoWindowRegister``, which
aliases it into CCO's flat LSA space -- so ``buffer_ptrs`` are ``ccoGetPeerPtr`` results
and agree with the device-side ``Window.lsa_ptr`` by construction. CCO's communicator is
created on the first rendezvous of a process group and its unique id travels over torch's
own Store, so there is no second bootstrap channel to configure::

    import torch.distributed._symmetric_memory as symm_mem
    from mori.allocator import register_symm_backend

    symm_mem.set_backend("MORI")   # importing mori.allocator registers it

    t   = symm_mem.empty(1024, dtype=torch.bfloat16, device=device)
    hdl = symm_mem.rendezvous(t, group_name)
    peer = hdl.get_buffer(1, (1024,), torch.bfloat16)

``enable_symm_mem_for_group()`` is not needed: the group is resolved with
``resolve_process_group()``, the way torch's own CUDA and NCCL backends do it, rather
than through the ``GroupInfo`` registry that only that deprecated call populates.

Known constraint on the POSIX-fd path (gfx9, i.e. MI300/MI355): CCO names its rendezvous
socket after the local slot offset, and freeing a window returns that slot to a per-rank
allocator. Ranks that free symmetric tensors in *different* orders therefore get different
offsets, and a later ``rendezvous()`` fails with a P2P fd exchange timeout. Free order is
unconstrained as far as torch is concerned, so keep it uniform across ranks until that
naming changes. The fabric path is unaffected -- peer addressing is computed from each
rank's own offset.

Peers are exposed the way torch's model expects, as the ``buffer_ptrs`` /
``buffer_ptrs_dev`` array -- one base address per rank, same as every other backend.

Internally the ranks are mapped into one flat span, so those pointers happen to be evenly
strided (``buffer_ptrs[r] == buffer_ptrs[0] + r*stride``). That is deliberately not public
yet: exposing it belongs with mori's cco window, whose ``ccoWindowDevice`` already defines
the layout (``winBase``, 4 GiB-quantised ``stride4G``, LSA-rank indexing). See ROCm/mori#557
for the staged plan.

The handle type is probed per device: fabric where supported, POSIX fd otherwise. gfx9
(MI300/MI355) has no fabric support -- ``hipMemCreate`` itself reports "operation not
supported" -- so those fall back to fd, which needs no configuration. The allocation and
CCO's own export have to agree on that type, since CCO re-exports what it imports.

``MORI_SYMM_PER_RANK_VMM`` sizes the communicator's flat VA reservation (default 4 GiB).
It is a floor rather than a budget -- CCO quantises it up to 4 GiB -- and it bounds live
symmetric memory per rank, not allocations over time, because slots are recycled on free.

The signal pad is always there, as its own CCO allocation and window rather than a tail
appended to the buffer -- the same split NCCL's backend uses. torch's own ``symm_mem``
collectives synchronise through it, so they work without any build flag.

``barrier()`` runs over CCO's host barrier, which means the current stream is drained
first: stronger than the device-side barrier torch asks for, and heavier.
``put_signal``/``wait_signal`` still raise -- point-to-point signalling needs a
``ccoDevComm``, which this backend does not create yet.

``rendezvous()`` takes the tensor's *storage* base, so ``get_offset()`` is 0 by
construction: every ``alloc()`` is its own VMM allocation. Handing it a view
(``rendezvous(t[512:])``) therefore describes the whole storage, and ``get_remote_tensor``
answers for the storage base -- pass ``storage_offset`` to ``get_buffer`` to address a
slice. That is torch's model, not something this backend narrows.

The extension is optional and its ABI tracks the installed torch, so it is a plugin:
``pip install`` prebuilds it when it can (``BUILD_TORCH_SYMM=AUTO``, the default; ``ON``
makes a failure fatal, ``OFF`` skips it), and a build that did not happen or no longer
loads is compiled here on first import from the sources shipped in ``_jit-sources``. So
switching torch does not require reinstalling mori. ``MORI_SYMM_FORCE_JIT=1`` ignores the
prebuilt module.
